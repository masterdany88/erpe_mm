      <!-- Dom4j is a transitive dependency of errai-jpa-client and needs to be on classpath.
           It is also used by Hibernate and adding it directly into WEB-INF/lib results in
           "org.dom4j.DocumentException: org.dom4j.DocumentFactory cannot be cast to org.dom4j.DocumentFactory"
           Depending on the EAP module seems to be the only way.
           See https://developer.jboss.org/thread/173306 for more info. -->
